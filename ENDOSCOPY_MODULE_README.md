# Endoscopy Screen Module - Complete Implementation

## Overview
This module implements a comprehensive Endoscopy screen following the same architecture pattern as the Labs screen, with four distinct sections for different endoscopy types.

## üìÅ Files Created

### 1. Model
- **`lib/core/models/endoscopy.dart`**
  - Single unified model for all endoscopy types
  - Fields: id, patientId, type, date, ec, endoscopist, followUp, report, createdAt
  - Type field differentiates between: OGD, Colonoscopy, ERCP, EUS

### 2. Cubits (State Management)
- **`lib/features/managers/endoscopy/ogd_cubit.dart`** - OGD state management
- **`lib/features/managers/endoscopy/colonoscopy_cubit.dart`** - Colonoscopy state management
- **`lib/features/managers/endoscopy/ercp_cubit.dart`** - ERCP state management
- **`lib/features/managers/endoscopy/eus_cubit.dart`** - EUS state management

Each cubit:
- Filters data by type (OGD, Colonoscopy, ERCP, or EUS)
- Shares the same 'endoscopy' database table
- Provides add, delete, and loadForPatient methods

### 3. Section Widgets
- **`lib/features/widgets/ogd_section_widgets.dart`** - OGD section UI (Red gradient)
- **`lib/features/widgets/colonoscopy_section_widgets.dart`** - Colonoscopy section UI (Teal gradient)
- **`lib/features/widgets/ercp_section_widgets.dart`** - ERCP section UI (Orange gradient)
- **`lib/features/widgets/eus_section_widgets.dart`** - EUS section UI (Purple gradient)

Each section includes:
- Section title and add button
- List of records with beautiful card design
- Delete functionality
- Add dialog with form fields

### 4. Main Screen
- **`lib/features/screens/endoscopy_screen.dart`** - Main endoscopy screen
  - Provides all four cubits via MultiBlocProvider
  - Displays all four sections in a scrollable column
  - Requires Patient object as parameter

## üé® Design Features

### Color Coding
- **OGD**: Red gradient (#FF6B6B ‚Üí #EE5A6F)
- **Colonoscopy**: Teal gradient (#4ECDC4 ‚Üí #44A08D)
- **ERCP**: Orange gradient (#FFBE0B ‚Üí #FB8500)
- **EUS**: Purple gradient (#9B59B6 ‚Üí #8E44AD)

### UI Elements
- ‚úÖ Modern gradient buttons
- ‚úÖ Card-based list items with colored accent strips
- ‚úÖ Icon avatars with matching colors
- ‚úÖ Info chips for displaying data
- ‚úÖ Date picker for date selection
- ‚úÖ Gradient dialog headers
- ‚úÖ Smooth animations and shadows

## üìä Data Structure

Each endoscopy record contains:
```dart
{
  id: int (auto-generated),
  patientId: int (required),
  type: String (OGD/Colonoscopy/ERCP/EUS),
  date: String (ISO format),
  ec: String (EC number/code),
  endoscopist: String (doctor's name),
  followUp: String (follow-up notes),
  report: String (detailed report),
  createdAt: String (ISO timestamp)
}
```

## üîÑ Integration

To use the Endoscopy screen, you need to pass a Patient object:

```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => EndoscopyScreen(patient: yourPatient),
  ),
);
```

Or if it's part of a tab/navigation system, ensure the Patient is passed from the parent widget.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database

All endoscopy records are stored in a single table named **`endoscopy`** with these columns:
- id
- patient_id
- type (discriminator: OGD, Colonoscopy, ERCP, EUS)
- date
- ec
- endoscopist
- follow_up
- report
- created_at

The table is created automatically on first use via SQLite dynamic table creation.

## ‚ú® Features

1. **Separate Sections**: Four distinct sections, one for each endoscopy type
2. **Color Differentiation**: Each type has unique gradient colors
3. **Unified Data Model**: Single model/table with type discrimination
4. **Consistent UX**: Follows the same pattern as the Labs screen
5. **Responsive Design**: Beautiful cards with shadows and gradients
6. **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, and Delete functionality
7. **Date Management**: Easy date selection with date picker
8. **Empty States**: Friendly empty state with add button

## üöÄ Next Steps

If you want to add more features:
- Add edit functionality (currently only add and delete)
- Add image attachment support for endoscopy images
- Add export/print functionality
- Add filtering and search capabilities
- Add sorting by date or other fields
