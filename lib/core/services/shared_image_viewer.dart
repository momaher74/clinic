// This file used to provide a sharedOpenImage implementation.
// The canonical sharedOpenImage function is defined in
// `lib/core/constants/constants.dart` and should be used across the app.

// Keep this file in place for compatibility, but do not export any symbols
// that conflict with the central implementation.

// If you see duplicate-definition errors referencing sharedOpenImage,
// remove imports of this file and use the one in constants.dart instead.
